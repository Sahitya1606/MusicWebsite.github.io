        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings.<br>Guitars can be divided into two broad categories, acoustic and electric<br> guitars.Within each of these categories, there are also further sub-categories.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">Before the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic<br> materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having "a long,<br> fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, with incurved sides."</p>
        <h3 style="color:white ;font-display: bold;font-size: 30px;">Accoustic Guitars:</h3>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">They form several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group:<br> classical and flamenco guitars; steel-string guitars, which include the <br>flat-topped, or "folk", guitar; twelve-string guitars; and the arched-top guitar.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play<br> in different registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a similar<br> tuning to that of the electric bass guitar.</p>
        <h3 style="color:white ;font-display: bold;font-size: 30px;">Electric Guitars</h3>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">They can have solid, semi-hollow, or hollow bodies; solid bodies produce little<br> sound without amplification. In contrast to a standard acoustic guitar,<br> electric guitars instead rely on electromagnetic pickups.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">The sound is frequently modified by other electronic devices.The electric guitar <br>is used extensively in jazz, blues, R & B, and rock and roll.</p>
