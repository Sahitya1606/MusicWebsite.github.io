        <p  style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical <br>and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo <br>trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass<br> trumpet.Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as <br>signalling devices in battle or hunting,dating back to at least 1500 BC.</p>
        <p  style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras,<br> concert bands,jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music.</p>
        <p  style="color: white; font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">The most common type is the B♭ trumpet, but A, C, D, E♭, E, low F,<br> and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most <br>common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside<br> the B♭ trumpet.</p>
